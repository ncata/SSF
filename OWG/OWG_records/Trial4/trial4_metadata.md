OWG Notes:
Trial 4:
  Time: 2017, 70 % of data, 30% held for independent validation
  Wall time: 1 hour 31 seconds
  Batch size: 13
  Resolution: 512x512
  Number of images: 355
  mse loss: 0.0428
  mae: 0.1656
  R 2 value: 0.89402
  MAPE: 28.694133444029426
  Notes:
    Fourth trial using GLERL imagery.
     During training, 40% of available images were used for training while 60% were used for validation.
     Average epoch took 26sec, a drop of over 40% as compared to trial 3.
     This change of hyperparameters did not bring on desired results.
     Overall, less effective.
  Application:
    Number of images: 245
    R 2 value: 0.63963
    MAPE: 54.67494666417291
    Notes: This trial performed poorly in application.
