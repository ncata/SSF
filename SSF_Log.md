## 06/07/21  
* 9am-10am: Meeting with Chris Sherwood. Recorded weekly to do list. Installed Irfan Viewer and bookmarked nbviewer. 
* 10am-11am: Review MI City NOAA GLERL webpage. Noted that coordinates provided are not precise enough to point to current or past webcam placement. Identified View 1 image 9 (06/06/2021 19:03 EDT) as shifting relative to images 8 and 10 in the 06/06/2021 12-hour animation. Noted disparity between archived image time and the time displayed on the image itself-probably the time between the photo being taken versus the time the photo was uploaded. First several photos in the 10 day archive were not accessible. 
* 11am-2pm: Created a jupyter notebook for practicing aligning images from the MI City lighthouse. Took a lunch break during that time.
* 2pm-3pm: Reviewed SurfRCat paper 'SurfRCat: A tool for remote calibration of pre-exsisting coastal cameras to enable their use a quantitative coastal monitoring tools" (Conlin et al., 2020). More precise data regarding lat, lon, elevation, and azimuth of GLERL webcams would be needed by LiDAR data should be available. 
* 3pm-5pm: Reauthorized ArcGIS 10.7.1 licencse and created a rudimentary map showing the MI City GLERL webcam view #1. Continued reviewing GLERL webpage and exploring links-still unable to find archived photos past previous 10 days. Looked through SurfRCat repository again.
